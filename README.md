#frontend

This is the website I did in March.
It's not fully functional yet (you can't change the Icon-Theme yet or switch to the dark mode,
and the weather data isn't being synchronized yet either) 
I didn't really have the time to work on this websiteanymore. 
However it might still be useful to you :)
